# Decomposition of phenotypic heterogeneity in autism reveals distinct and coherent genetic programs

# **System Requirements** 

## Hardware requirements

The code in this repository requires only a standard computer with enough RAM to support the operations defined in the scripts. Only a CPU is needed to run all code in this repository.

## Software requirements

The conda environment used in the testing of all scripts is described in `conda_requirements.txt`, which contains all software dependencies, including version numbers.

We recommend starting a new conda environment using the requirements file:

```
conda create --name asd_env --file conda_requirements.txt
conda activate asd_env
conda list # verify the installation
```

### **Data Availability**

In order to abide by the informed consents that individuals with autism and their family members signed when agreeing to participate in a SFARI cohort (SSC and SPARK), researchers must be approved by SFARI Base (https://base.sfari.org).
